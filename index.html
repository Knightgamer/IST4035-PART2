            The new School of Humanities and Social Sciences (SHSS) building
            will go a long way in enhancing humanities and social sciences
            education programs. It provides classroom space, laboratory teaching
            and research facilities, office areas, meeting rooms and auditorium
            lecture rooms. In addition, there are fourteen flexible meeting
            rooms which are set up for modern teaching methods with the latest
            audio-visual equipment. It also features a covered terrace and
            glazed façade. It is located within the academic zone in line with
            the USIU-Africa master plan. The location is adjacent to the Science
            Centre and sports fields, and is easily accessed from Gate B.

            The building design facilitates social learning by creating spaces
            where students can easily connect and collaborate. The new complex
            will double the existing classroom capacity as it will accommodate
            1,500 students at a time.

            The 25 smart classrooms, with a seating capacity of 60 during
            regular session and about 35 students with social distancing, are a
            welcome addition to the instruction space at USIU-Africa. This will
            expand the institution’s ability to return to face-to-face learning
            during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to develop and implement
            more market driven degree programs. Most important, the smart
            classrooms will enhance the quality of delivery by instructors and
            learning by students.
